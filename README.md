The current repository consists of two parts:
- a Haskell program constructing unambiguous υ-reduction grammars partitioning
  the set of λυ-terms into classes of terms υ-normalising in a given number of
  leftmost-outermost reduction steps (in particular, computing their generating functions); and
- a Mathematica script meant to compute the corresponding asymptotic densities.
